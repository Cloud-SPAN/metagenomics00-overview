[Cloud-SPAN](https://cloud-span.york.ac.uk) is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) at the University of York and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award. It aims to train researchers to effectively generate and analyse a range of 'omics data using Cloud computing resources.

This course teaches data analysis for metagenomics projects. It covers how to:
- generate and QC a metagenome assembly
- 'bin' the assembly into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) also known as bins
- identify the taxonomy of these MAGs.
- calculate diversity metrics and add functional annotation to identify the products of genes identified in the assembled MAGs.

> ## Prerequisites
This course assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop but learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of microbiome. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively.
To get started, follow the directions in the Setup tab to get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

> ## Data
> This course uses data from a mock metagenome community published from [Ultra-deep, long-read nanopore sequencing of mock microbial community standards](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/5/giz043/5486468) which has long and short read sequencing data and has been used for benchmarking metagenome tools.
